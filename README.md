# Zendesk Guide Redirection

## Summary
Currently there is no way to redirect Zendesk Guide articles using a 301 redirect. 

While this a 301 is the right way to forward a URL, it is currently not an option for Zendesk Guide users. In certain instances, however, redirection is still necessary for education, content availability, and a positive end user experience.

The JS script contained in this repository provides a workaround to redirect end users from archived Zendesk Guide articles to either a new article or a new URL altogether.
